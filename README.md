# Air-Quality-Index-Analysis

## Description
- Developed a webpage to inform users about past air pollution levels in India.
- Features include AQI explanations, interactive maps, and state-wise trends.
- Aimed at individuals, organizations, and researchers for informed decisions and environmental awareness.

## Technologies:

**Front-end**: HTML, JavaScript, Plotly
**Back-end**: Python, JSP
**Data**: CSV (AQI data from 2020-2023)

## Main Page:
- Explains the AQI concept and its significance.
- Provides information on air quality standards and descriptions of various pollutants.
- Lists harmful effects of air pollution on human health and the environment.

## Map Page:
- Displays an interactive map using Plotly.
- Visualizes the AQI distribution across India.
- Lists the top 10 cities with the highest AQI levels for each pollutant.

## State Page:
- Enables users to explore AQI trends for individual states.
- Provides date-wise, month-wise, and year-wise AQI charts for each state.
- Offers insights into air quality patterns over time.

## Future Enhancements:

- Implement machine learning models to predict and classify pollutant distribution across states.
- Develop AI-powered AQI forecasts for future dates.
- Integrate real-time sensor data for dynamic updates.

## Target Users:
- Individuals concerned about air quality and its impact on their health.
- Environmental organizations and regulatory bodies.
- Public health researchers and policymakers.

## Benefits:
- Empowers users to make informed decisions about their health and activities.
- Supports air quality monitoring and management initiatives.
- Raises awareness about environmental pollution and its consequences.

## Overall, this project aims to provide a valuable tool for understanding air quality and promoting environmental awareness in India.
